Hi, I'm Jos√© Scott, a PhD student in the astrophysics lab of Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil. Currently my research focuses on galactic astronomy, studying star clusters as building blocks of galaxies.

In my work a use much of Data Science to analyse astronomy data. On this page, I want to share my work and some related topics that I like, such as simulation physics.

I'm not a computer scientist, so I believe that I'm much to lear specially in this area. I hope that you can learn, but also teach me. I'm always open to comments, suggestions and questions.

You can contact me through email: je.paes.scott@gmail.com and Instagram @je. scott07.

I hope you enjoy the content.
